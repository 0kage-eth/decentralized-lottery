# DECENTRALIZED LOTTERY

## Summary

We want to build a smart lottery that is fully automated and runs on smart contracts. A fully decentralized lottery has the following features:

- Odds are completely random
- There is no house that declares winners - computer code decides a winner
- Results are completely transparent & fair. Lottery vault addresses are easy to monitor
- Fund transfers are instantaneous without delay
- Lottery start & close is predictable and known in advance to all participants

This is a open source project that currently runs on Goerli Network.
